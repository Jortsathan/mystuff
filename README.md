## My Learning Python the Hard Way

This repo is just an upload of my files used in learning Python via - http://learnpythonthehardway.org/book/

This exl.py file includes all examples 1 - 24 including the notes written for examples 22 - 24 as of : 12/23/15

Probably a sloppy way to code, but I included all the examples hard code in the same 1 file in case I wanted to 
quickly reuse anything for future examples.

Also my foray into the Git universe.

NOTE: INTENDED FOR PERSONAL LEARNING PURPOSES ONLY, ANY CODE RECREATED VIA THIS PROJECT IS SUBJECT TO IT'S CREATOR,
